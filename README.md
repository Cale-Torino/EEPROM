# EEPROM

Affordable commonly available **EEPROMs** in *south africa* and how to use them.

When looking for components I always keep a few points in mind
- Must be Affordable
- A good price to value ratio
- Has to be commonly available in South Africa
- A good Documentation must be available
- It should Work with my MCU (mostly the AtMega 328P or ESP8266,ESP32)

In this case I needed an EEPROM for a project where I would save `433.92Mhz` *RF* codes to be used to identify certain devices.

It's easy to go to RS Components South Africa but they are expensive and sometimes require bulk shipping or long wait times. 

Mouser Electronics has a similar problem for makers and students.

I am constantly looking for new electronics distributers and occasionally find a few good gems to test out.

My list as of now contains a few decent sellers

Two series of EEPROM seem to be quite common the *24L I2C* chips from Microchip and the *AT24 I2C* chips originally from Atmel now also from Microchip, with the former being much more available I decided to use that series.

*IMPORTANT never ever by electronic IC components from takealot the prices are extremely inflated and the price to value ratio is terrible!

I managed to find a suitable line of EEPROM ICs the *Microchip Technology 24L I2C Serial EEPROM* series.

There are a few different sizes, they are low powered, decent enough for makers/students and are offered in the DIP package.

The datasheet is well maintained and the ICs have been around for a long time all good indicators.

But most importantly they have a good price to value ratio and are commonly available in South Africa.
